# KeepSafe

**KeepSafe** is your private, encrypted vault for thoughts, plans, and personal information. Designed for individuals who value privacy and security, KeepSafe ensures your notes are protected by advanced, end-to-end encryption—accessible only by you, and never exposed to third parties.

With seamless authentication options including Google, GitHub, and traditional password-based login, KeepSafe adds an extra layer of protection through multi-factor authentication (MFA). Whether you’re jotting down ideas, storing sensitive documents, or managing your digital life, your content stays safe, encrypted, and truly yours.
